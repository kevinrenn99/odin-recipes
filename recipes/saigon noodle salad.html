    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This Vietnamese-style noodle salad is my 'too hot to cook' staple. 
        It is bursting with flavor and makes great use of leftover grilled meat or shrimp.</p>
    <h6>Ingredients</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Lime juice</li>
        <li>Fish Sauce</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Sriracha</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Steps</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, 
            and Sriracha together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a full boil; remove from heat and soak rice noodles in the hot water for 1 minute. 
            Stir to separate the noodles and continue soaking until the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes more. 
            Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until cooled. Shake noodles in colander to drain as much water as possible.</li>
        <li>Mix noodles, cabbage, carrots, shrimp, bean sprouts, cucumber slices, green onions, mint, cilantro, and basil 
            together in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Top with chopped peanuts.</li>
    </ol>
